## Invasive Stimulation Treatments

### Deep Brain Stimulation

A more invasive experimental treatment for severe depression is deep brain stimulation (DBS). This treatment involves the implantation of electrodes deep within the brain. Electrical current is then administered to modulate activity in the targeted brain region (see Figure 14.12B). DBS is used with some regularity to treat Parkinson’s disease, a movement disorder (Hardesty and Sackeim, 2007; see Chapter 4). Researchers have examined whether DBS targeted toward either the subgenual cingulate cortex or the nucleus accumbens might alleviate depression, given the postulated roles of these regions in the disorder (see Anderson et al., 2012, for review).

对于重度抑郁症一种更加侵入式的治疗方法是深脑刺激（DBS）。这个治疗方法涉及在脑内植入电极。电流旨在调节目标大脑区域的活动（见14.12B）。DBS用于定时治疗帕金森病，一种运动疾病。研究者考虑到下膝侧扣带或者伏隔核的在疾病中的假定作用，已经检查了是否对这些区域采用DBS方法可能减轻抑郁症的。

An initial study focusing on the subgenual cingulate cortex examined six patients with severe treatment-resistant depression (Mayberg et al., 2005). After DBS to the subgenual cingulate, the symptoms of four of these patients improved. These improvements were accompanied by decreases in activity of subgenual regions. Although the number of participants was small, the study generated interest in the potential promise of this treatment. A follow-up study examined a larger sample of 20 patients (including the six patients from the prior study) (Lozano et al., 2008). Approximately a year after the DBS procedure, 55% of the patients met criteria for “response,” which was defined as a 50% decrease in rated symptoms of depression.

一个聚焦于下膝侧扣带皮质的初步研究检查了6个具有严重治疗顽固型抑郁症的病人。在对下膝状扣带进行DBS刺激后，四个病人的症状得到了改善。这些改善伴随着下膝状区域活动的减少。虽然病人的数量很小，研究带来了治疗方法上的潜在希望。一个随后的研究检查了20个病人的大样本（包括先前研究的6个病人）。大约DBS过程之后一年，55%的病人达到了“响应”的标准，这被定义为抑郁症状50%程度的减轻。


Researchers have also targeted the nucleus accumbens, a subcortical brain region that plays an important role in reward motivation. As reviewed earlier, because depression is characterized by [anhedonia](https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=17900), or absence of pleasure, it is logical to posit dysfunction within the reward pathways. Preliminary studies suggest that DBS targeted toward the nucleus accumbens (and the medial forebrain bundle, a fiber bundle that is connected to it) may have beneficial effects in treatment-resistant depression (Schlaepfer et al., 2014).

研究者也针对伏隔核，一个在奖励动机方面扮演重要角色的皮质下大脑区域。正如之前看到的，因为抑郁是由快感缺乏，或者缺少快乐，把它放在奖励路径的失能是合理的。先前的研究表明DBS导向的伏隔核（和内前脑束，一种连接伏隔核的纤维束）可能在治疗顽固型抑郁症中有作用。

Needless to say, implanting electrodes inside the brain is a risky procedure. Risks include complications from the surgery itself and the potential for seizures induced by the electrical current. For these reasons, it is likely that DBS will only be a treatment of last resort for patients with severe depression who have already exhausted other options. Furthermore, knowledge of the effectiveness of the procedure is still preliminary. Few studies to date have included control groups, in which patients are randomly assigned to placebo or sham-operated conditions instead of the active treatment condition. There are good reasons for not including such controls in initial tests of the intervention; for example, it is ethically questionable to administer a sham surgery. However, full evaluation of the success of the procedure will ultimately require the comparison of treatment groups with adequate control groups.

不用说，大脑中植入电极是一个危险的过程。风险包括手术本身的并发症和由电流引起的潜在的癫痫。由于这些原因，DBS很可能是治疗已经穷尽其他方法的严重抑郁症患者的最后手段。更进一步，关于这个过程有效性的知识还非常初步。目前几乎没有研究在其中包含控制组，病人随机分配安慰剂或者假装操作过的条件而不是激活的治疗条件。在初步试验中不包括控制组具有很好的理由；例如，采用一次假手术是在道德上存疑的。然而，这个过程成功效果的完整估计将会最终需要足够控制组和治疗组的比较。
