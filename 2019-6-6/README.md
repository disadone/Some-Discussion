### Symptoms and Features

One issue that complicates research on depression is the vast array of symptoms, subtypes, and variations. Generally speaking, depression is a mood disorder characterized by chronic feelings of sadness and hopelessness and loss of interest or pleasure in activities that once were enjoyed. Other typical symptoms include poor appetite or overeating, insomnia (difficulty falling asleep or early-morning awakening) or hypersomnia (too much sleeping), low energy, slowed thinking and actions, low self-esteem, poor concentration and difficulty making decisions, and suicidal thoughts (DSM-5, American Psychiatric Association, 2013). As you can see, these symptoms encompass many domains of functioning, including affect, motivation, cognition, and regulation of the body’s homeostatic systems.

一个使得抑郁症研究复杂化的问题是抑郁症具有大量的症状，子类和变种。通常来说，抑郁是一种被描述为长期的悲伤与无望以及对曾经享受的活动丧失行徐的情绪紊乱。其他典型的症状包括低食欲或者饮食过量，失眠（难以入睡或早醒）或者嗜睡（睡得太多），精力不足，思维与行动迟滞，低自尊，低注意力和难以做决定以及自杀想法（DSM-5）。如你所见，这些症状包括许多功能领域，包括情感，动机，认知和身体稳态系统的调节。

While these features describe major depression, variations are also possible. A milder state of chronic depression lasting at least two years has been termed **dysthymia**. Depression can be seasonal, with a typical onset during mid-fall as the days quickly grow shorter and relief in the spring as the days quickly grow longer. Depression can also be interspersed between periods of mania. During manic episodes, the person often experiences **euphoria**, rushes of energy, reckless impulses to engage excessively in pleasurable activities such as sex and shopping, irritability, racing thoughts, and a sense of grandiose power. When mania occurs, either alternating with a depressive episode or occurring alone, a person is described as having bipolar disorder. At this point, it is unclear whether all of these variations of depression share similar neurocognitive characteristics, or whether each should be considered a unique entity. For present purposes, our discussion will focus primarily on **major depressive disorder**, the defining features of which include a profound negative mood, lack of interest in pleasurable activities, and feelings of helplessness and hopelessness.

虽然这些特征描述了严重的抑郁症，这些特征也可能发生变化。长期抑郁的一种温和状态持续至少两年曾经被称为**心境恶劣**。抑郁可以是季节性的，一个典型的发作时间是在秋季中期，这时白天很快过去并在春天随着白天变长而很快缓解。抑郁症也会在躁狂症发作时穿插。在躁狂时期，人们经常体验到**欣快异常**，精力充沛，具有鲁莽的冲动过度参与与快乐相关的活动例如性交和购物，烦躁，思绪翻腾，以及感受到宏大力量。当躁狂症发生时，无论是在抑郁期交替或者单独出现，一个人就会被描述为双向情感障碍。这时，不太清楚所有的这些变化共享相似的认知特点，或者是否将每一个变化视为一个独特的实体。目前而言，我们的讨论主要聚焦于重度抑郁症，定义的特征包括严重的负面情绪，缺乏对娱乐活动的兴趣，并且感到无助和无望。

Cognitive characteristics of depression have been well studied, and offer some clues to possible neural systems that may be disrupted. Most notably, memory and attention are biased toward negative events and interpretations in ways that create **a self-perpetuating cycle of rumination about negative experiences** (Disner et al., 2011; Mineka et al., 2003). Further, people with depression often perform poorly on standard tasks of executive functions (Snyder, 2013). Depressed people tend to recover poorly from mistakes and have difficulty with negative feedback, for example, showing increasingly poor performance after making errors (Murphy et al., 2003; Steele et al., 2007). Finally, depressed individuals exhibit relatively poor performance on tasks that depend on the right hemisphere, such as judgment of line orientation, three-dimensional constructional skills, face recognition, and spatial association learning (Levin et al., 2007). As you can see, multiple domains of cognition are affected by depression, implicating multiple brain regions (Clark et al., 2009).

抑郁症的认知特征已经得到很好的研究，并且提供了可能受到干扰的神经系统的线索。最值得注意的是，记忆和注意力偏向负面事件和解释，从而产生一种关于负面体验的自我延续的循环思考。更进一步，具有抑郁症的人通常在执行功能的标准任务上表现不佳。抑郁症人群倾向于在错误中恢复很差并且对于负面反馈的反应有困难，例如，展现出在犯错后更差的表现。最后，抑郁的个体在涉及右半球的的人物上表现相对较差，例如判断线的方向，三维空间构造能力，面孔识别，与空间有关的学习。正如你看到的，认知的多个领域受到抑郁症的影响，意味着多个脑区受到影响。
