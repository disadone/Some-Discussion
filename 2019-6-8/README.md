### Therapeutic Interventions

Treatment for depression typically involves intervention at either the cognitive or the biological level, or both in combination. Cognitive therapy consists of identifying self-defeating and pessimistic thought patterns in depression and trying to alter those ways of thinking. Biologically based interventions often involve treatment with medication. Both cognitive therapy and antidepressant medication are relatively effective in treating depression in many people (Kamenov et al., 2017). In addition, treatment methods based on noninvasive stimulation of the brain have been developed in recent years. In the following sections, we review what is known about the neural mechanisms involved in the treatment of depression and consider novel treatments that have been developed based on cognitive neuroscience findings.

### How Standard Treatments for Depression Affect the Brain

Depression is often treated with drugs that affect the monoamine neurotransmitter systems of the brain (see Chapter 1). Typical drug treatments include serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine (Prozac) and escitalopram (Lexapro), which target the serotonin systems that are spread throughout the brain. Some other antidepressant drugs affect other monoamine neurotransmitter systems, such as the norepinephrine and dopamine systems (Iosifescu et al., 2013).

Although these drugs are well characterized at the molecular level – meaning that their immediate effects on the synapse are well understood – it is not yet clear exactly how or why they make depressive symptoms better. One possibility is that they restore a normal balance of neurotransmitter function through long-term changes in receptor sensitivity (e.g., Duman, 2009). Another proposal is that these drugs may produce their therapeutic action by stimulating neurogenesis or other aspects of nerve cell growth (e.g., Hill et al., 2015; Sahay and Hen, 2007; Santarelli et al., 2003). Regardless of the precise mechanism of action at the cellular level, neuroimaging studies indicate that pharmacological treatment of depression tends to reduce the response of the amygdala to negative information, while increasing prefrontal cortex responses (Wessa and Lois, 2015).

A cognitive neuroscience framework may help to bridge the gap between biochemical and psychological models of depression. For example, Figure 14.11 presents an integrated model of depression that incorporates many levels of analysis, from neurochemical through cognitive features, and also illustrates the possible points of intervention targeted by pharmacological therapy and cognitive therapy (Roiser et al., 2012). According to this model, antidepressant drugs may work by influencing relatively low-level neural systems that create biases toward negative (unpleasant or threatening) stimuli in the environment (such as unfriendly faces or negative words), whereas cognitive therapies may work to address higher-level mental schemas or belief systems that are known to be maladaptive in depression (such as the depressed person’s belief that things will never get better or that he or she is generally inadequate). Although there is still much to be worked out in such a model, it moves away from an “either/or” conception of drug versus cognitive therapy and allows for the possibility that both are effective through somewhat different neurocognitive mechanisms.

An exciting area of current research involves using imaging methods, and other biological markers, to identify which people exhibiting symptoms of depression are most likely to respond well to treatment. Knowledge gained in this area could ultimately have significant benefits, as physicians and psychologists could target specific drug or psychological treatments to the patients most likely to benefit from them, rather than using a “trial-and-error” approach to choose between possible treatments for individual patients. Some research suggests that brain imaging methods may be useful in this regard. For example, a recent meta-analysis found that people with higher baseline levels of activity in the anterior cingulate cortex were more likely to show clinical improvement with traditional drug or psychotherapeutic treatments for depression (Fu et al., 2013). Conversely, the same study found that participants with higher baseline activity in the insula and striatum were less likely to respond well to such treatment. Although our knowledge in this area is still incomplete due to limitations in existing studies (Phillips et al., 2015), the possibility of individually tailored treatment approaches based on patterns of brain activity is a promising avenue for future research.
