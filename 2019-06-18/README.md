Consistent with this model, multiple studies have found that activity in the nucleus accumbens and other ventral striatal structures is increased in adolescents both when they anticipate and when they receive a reward. This activity level in the ventral striatum is higher in adolescents compared to younger children, and also higher compared to adults. And in longitudinal studies, activity in the striatum peaks in mid-adolescence and then declines thereafter. At the same time, activity in the lateral region of the prefrontal cortex is lower in adolescents compared to adults (see Shulman et al., 2016, for review). Putting these two pieces together, the adolescents displayed a unique pattern, not seen in either children or adults, of elevated limbic responses in combination with relatively lower prefrontal responses. The exaggerated limbic response to rewards could explain why when no reward is involved, adolescents tend to show adult-like skills in logical reasoning. However, when strong emotional incentives are present, they are much more likely to make risky choices (see also Somerville et al., 2011; Steinberg, 2005).

Researchers are also especially interested in the adolescent brain because many forms of psychological distress either emerge for the first time or become worse during the adolescent years. For example, during adolescence, the risk for depression increases to adult levels for the first time, and the gender difference in depression emerges (e.g., Davey et al., 2008; Hyde et al., 2008). Substance abuse and schizophrenia may also have their first onset during the adolescent years. Of course, there are numerous social as well as biological reasons why psychological disorders may increase in this time period, as people’s bodies and their social standing can both change dramatically, eliciting strong emotional reactions. We know from previous chapters that top-down control by the prefrontal regions over limbic regions is important in regulating emotions. During adolescence, the connection between these regions is still tenuous and social-emotional challenges are great. Therefore, it should not be surprising that difficulties in regulation of emotion may manifest during these years. In the long run, understanding the unique features of the adolescent brain may help explain why certain social-emotional problems emerge during this time period (Luciana, 2013).

While controlling emotional impulses is an important key to surviving adolescence, understanding the complex social world is also crucial (Blakemore, 2010; Somerville, 2013). Adolescents tend to be obsessed with social status and belonging to social groups. This, in turn, requires a level of cognitive sophistication in order to understand what other people think and feel. For example, adolescents are quicker than younger children in answering questions about another person’s perspective (e.g., “A girl is not allowed to go to her best friend’s party. How does she feel?”; Choudhury et al., 2006). As discussed in Chapter 13, certain brain regions – such as the medial prefrontal region, temporoparietal junction, and superior temporal sulcus – are believed to be important in understanding the thoughts and feelings of others. These regions are activated in both adolescents and adults during tasks that require making inferences about another person’s mental state (compared to tasks that require inferences about physical causality); however, the pattern of activation is slightly different, with adolescents showing stronger activity in the medial prefrontal region and adults showing stronger activity in the superior temporal sulcus (Blakemore et al., 2007). These findings imply that adults and adolescents may be using different strategies to draw conclusions about other people’s mental states.

In sum, adolescence is a distinct developmental state, not simply an intermediate waystation between childhood and the beginning of adulthood. Unique neurobiological and psychological characteristics differentiate adolescence from childhood and adulthood. Understanding the specific cognitive, emotional, and neural features of adolescence is important not only for scientific reasons, but for the implications for public policy (e.g., Steinberg, 2013). For example, in Chapter 17, we consider how scientific understanding of the adolescent brain may alter conceptions of how juveniles should be treated in the criminal justice system.
