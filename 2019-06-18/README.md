Consistent with this model, multiple studies have found that activity in the nucleus accumbens and other ventral striatal structures is increased in adolescents both when they anticipate and when they receive a reward. This activity level in the ventral striatum is higher in adolescents compared to younger children, and also higher compared to adults. And in longitudinal studies, activity in the striatum peaks in mid-adolescence and then declines thereafter. At the same time, activity in the lateral region of the prefrontal cortex is lower in adolescents compared to adults (see Shulman et al., 2016, for review). Putting these two pieces together, the adolescents displayed a unique pattern, not seen in either children or adults, of elevated limbic responses in combination with relatively lower prefrontal responses. The exaggerated limbic response to rewards could explain why when no reward is involved, adolescents tend to show adult-like skills in logical reasoning. However, when strong emotional incentives are present, they are much more likely to make risky choices (see also Somerville et al., 2011; Steinberg, 2005).

与该模型一致，多项研究已经发现伏隔核和其他腹侧纹状体结构的活动在青少年预期奖励或者收到奖励时都增加。腹侧纹状体的活动水平相较于更年轻的儿童以成年人，青少年中更高。并且在纵向研究中，纹状体的活动在青春期中期达到顶峰并随后下降。同时，在前额皮质的外侧区域的活动相较于成年人，青少年更低。把这两点结合，青少年展示了一种独特的模式，在儿童或成年人中都没有显现，边缘系统反应升高，同时额叶响应减少。对于奖励产生的夸张的边缘系统响应可能解释了为什么当没有奖励时，青少年倾向于在逻辑推理中显现类似成年人的技能。然而，当强烈的情绪激励展现时，他们更可能采取更危险的选择。

Researchers are also especially interested in the adolescent brain because many forms of [psychological distress](https://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-psychological-distress-definition-lesson-quiz.html) either emerge for the first time or become worse during the adolescent years. For example, during adolescence, the risk for depression increases to adult levels for the first time, and the gender difference in depression emerges (e.g., Davey et al., 2008; Hyde et al., 2008). Substance abuse and schizophrenia may also have their first onset during the adolescent years. Of course, there are numerous social as well as biological reasons why psychological disorders may increase in this time period, as people’s bodies and their social standing can both change dramatically, eliciting strong emotional reactions. We know from previous chapters that top-down control by the prefrontal regions over limbic regions is important in regulating emotions. During adolescence, the connection between these regions is still tenuous and social-emotional challenges are great. Therefore, it should not be surprising that difficulties in regulation of emotion may manifest during these years. In the long run, understanding the unique features of the adolescent brain may help explain why certain social-emotional problems emerge during this time period (Luciana, 2013).

研究人员也特别对青少年的大脑感兴趣因为心理困扰的许多形式要么第一次出现要么在青少年时期变得更差。例如，在青少年时期，抑郁的风险首次增加到成年人的水平，并且抑郁的性别差异出现。物质滥用和精神分裂症也可能在青少年时期首次发作。当然，有许多在这段时期心理困扰增加的社会和生理的原因，因为人们的身体和他们的社会地位都会发生巨大的变化，产生强烈的情绪反应。我们从前一章知道，前额区域对边缘区域自上而下的控制在调节情绪中非常重要。在青少年时期，这些区域的联系仍然很脆弱并且社会情绪的挑战很大。因此，在这些年中情绪调节困难的增加应该不令人惊讶。在更长的时期，理解青少年大脑的独特特征可能帮助解释了为什么在这段时期某些社会情绪问题的出现。

While controlling emotional impulses is an important key to surviving adolescence, understanding the complex social world is also crucial (Blakemore, 2010; Somerville, 2013). Adolescents tend to be obsessed with social status and belonging to social groups. This, in turn, requires a level of cognitive sophistication in order to understand what other people think and feel. For example, adolescents are quicker than younger children in answering questions about another person’s perspective (e.g., “A girl is not allowed to go to her best friend’s party. How does she feel?”; Choudhury et al., 2006). As discussed in Chapter 13, certain brain regions – such as the medial prefrontal region, temporoparietal junction, and superior temporal sulcus – are believed to be important in understanding the thoughts and feelings of others. These regions are activated in both adolescents and adults during tasks that require making inferences about another person’s mental state (compared to tasks that require inferences about **physical causality**); however, the pattern of activation is slightly different, with adolescents showing stronger activity in the medial prefrontal region and adults showing stronger activity in the superior temporal sulcus (Blakemore et al., 2007). These findings imply that adults and adolescents may be using different strategies to draw conclusions about other people’s mental states.

虽然控制情绪冲动是度过青少年时期的关键，但理解复杂的世界也非常重要。青少年倾向于迷恋社会地位并且从属社会团体。这，反过来，需要一定水平的认知复杂性来理解其他人的所知所感。例如青少年比年少的儿童更快地回答关于另一个人观点的问题（例如，“一个女孩不被允许去她最好朋友的聚会，她有什么感受？”）。如在第十三章中讨论的，某些大脑区域-例如内侧前额区域，颞顶交界处，和上颞回-被认为在理解其他人想法和感觉很重要。在需要判断其他人的心理状态的任务中（相较于需要判断物理因果感知），这些区域在青少年和成年人都被激活；然而，激活的模式略有不同，青少年显示了在内侧前额区域的活动而成人显示了上颞回更强的活动。这些发现意味着成年人和青少年也许采用不同的策略得出其他人心理状态的结论。

In sum, adolescence is a distinct developmental state, not simply an intermediate waystation between childhood and the beginning of adulthood. Unique neurobiological and psychological characteristics differentiate adolescence from childhood and adulthood. Understanding the specific cognitive, emotional, and neural features of adolescence is important not only for scientific reasons, but for the implications for public policy (e.g., Steinberg, 2013). For example, in Chapter 17, we consider how scientific understanding of the adolescent brain may alter conceptions of how juveniles should be treated in the criminal justice system.

总之，青少年是一个独特的发展状态，不仅仅是童年和成年初期的中转站。独特的神经生物学和心理学特征区分了将青少年时期与儿童和成年期区分开。理解青少年特定的认知，情绪和神经特征不仅仅对于科学具有重要意义，也对公共政策很重要。例如，在第十七章中，我们考虑了青少年大脑的科学理解如何改变了刑事司法系统中怎样对待青少年的观念。
