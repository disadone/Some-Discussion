# Transitive Inference: Distinct Contributions of Rostrolateral Prefrontal Cortex and the Hippocampus

## Relation Integration Inspired them
Several researchers have argued that **rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC)** plays a key role in **relational integration**. If this hypothesis is correct, then RLPFC should play a key role in **transitive inference**, which requires the **integration of multiple relations** to reach a conclusion.

## Why does RLPFC relate to Relation Integration 


On the basis of the evidence that RLPFC is involved in relational integration, we ***hypothesized*** that this region should play a key role in transitive inference, which requires the joint consideration of multiple relations to reach a conclusion (e.g., if B → C and A → B, then A → C).

## Transitive inference , Memory and Hippocampus

Previous neuroscientific studies of transitive inferencehave focused primarily on the role of the hippocampus, a region implicated in relational memory.

-	one pattern in each pair would always hide a “smiling face”
-   They were then shown each of the pairings, along with the correct answer in each case, and instructed to remember the correct location of the smiling face
-   Participants were first trained and tested on the non-overlapping pairs, then on the overlapping pairs, and finally on a mixture of non-overlapping and overlapping pairs. 
-   This final testing session was similar in format to that used in the noninference conditions during scanning, with one difference: stimuli pairs were presented

-   This method of training ensured that **all participants would not only be able to learn the correct response for each pairing but would also be likely to hierarchically encode the overlapping stimulus set.**

Notably, all of the studies that have implicated the hippocampus in transitive inference involved retrieval of previously learned relations as a prerequisite for inference.

We ***hypothesized*** that the role of the hippocampus in these transitive inference tasks is related to **relational memory** requirements rather than to **relational integration** demands.

Two scenes, a sample stimulus and the corresponding test stimulus, were presented side by side and the participant was to indicate verbally what type of test stimulus they were viewing. If they provided an incorrect answer, they were prompted to try again, and when they identified a mismatching scene as such, they were to indicate specifically what had changed.
