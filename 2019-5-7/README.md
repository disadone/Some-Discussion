# Transitive Inference: Distinct Contributions of Rostrolateral Prefrontal Cortex and the Hippocampus

## Relation Integration Inspired them
Several researchers have argued that **rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC)** plays a key role in **relational integration**. If this hypothesis is correct, then RLPFC should play a key role in **transitive inference**, which requires the **integration of multiple relations** to reach a conclusion.

## Why does RLPFC relate to Relation Integration

* **Ravenʼs progressive matrices task**:combination of relational patterns

## Transitive inference , Memory and Hippocampus
Previous neuroscientific studies of transitive inferencehave focused primarily on the role of the hippocampus, a region implicated in relational memory.

* hippocampus was implicated in transitive inference over **odor relationships** in rats

-	one pattern in each pair would always hide a “smiling face”
-   They were then shown each of the pairings, along with the correct answer in each case, and instructed to remember the correct location of the smiling face
-   Participants were first trained and tested on the non-overlapping pairs, then on the overlapping pairs, and finally on a mixture of non-overlapping and overlapping pairs. 
-   This final testing session was similar in format to that used in the noninference conditions during scanning, with one difference: stimuli pairs were presented

-   This method of training ensured that **all participants would not only be able to learn the correct response for each pairing but would also be likely to hierarchically encode the overlapping stimulus set.**
