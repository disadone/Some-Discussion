Other studies have used neural measures to examine how information is processed differently when it has previously received a social stamp of approval. For example, one study examined ERP responses to stimuli for which the participant had previously agreed or disagreed with a fictitious social group (Schnuerch and Gibbon, 2015). The amplitude of the P2 response, indexing early attention to the stimulus, was greater if the participant had previously received feedback indicating that his or her rating of the stimulus was consistent with the group’s judgment (compared to stimuli in which the feedback indicated that the participant’s rating was inconsistent with the group). This evidence implies enhanced attention to stimuli when the individual’s prior judgment has been validated through group agreement.

另一些研究采用神经测量方法来检查当先前得到同意的社会印章时，信息是如何以不同的方式被处理的。例如，一个研究检查了被试先前认同或不认同一个虚构的社会团体时这种刺激的ERP响应。如果被试收到之前标示他或她的刺激评级是与团体判断一致的反馈，P2响应的幅度，即标示刺激的早期注意力，会更大（相较于表示参与者评级与团体不同的反馈）。这个证据表明当个体先前的判断通过团体同意得到认可时，对刺激的注意力增加。

To directly examine the brain regions that influence social conformity, researchers disrupted brain activity using TMS (Klucharev et al., 2011). Participants rated the attractiveness of faces and received feedback about social agreement or disagreement with each rating (similar to the task shown in Figure 13.3). Just before performing the task, the participants received either TMS that disrupted activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), sham TMS, or TMS to a control region thought to be uninvolved in social processing (parietal cortex). Medial prefrontal cortex was targeted because of the prior evidence that this region was activated in response to feedback indicating social disagreement (Klucharev et al., 2009). Compared to both of the other conditions, TMS to the mPFC disrupted conformity behavior, reducing the amount that participants’ subsequent ratings of the faces were influenced by the fictitious peer feedback. This study implies that mPFC plays a causal role in processes that influence us to conform to the judgments of others.

为了直接检查影响社会一致性的大脑区域，研究者采用TMS干扰大脑活动。被试对面孔的吸引力打分之后得到关于每个打分的社会认可或不认可（类似于图13.3的任务）。在任务执行前，被试就接受了内前额皮质，伪TMS或者在与社会处理无关的区域（顶叶皮质）进行TMS。内前额叶被设为目标是因为先前的证据表明这个区域在对于人们得到社会不认同的反馈时被激活。相较于其他两个条件，对于mPFC的TMS干扰了一致性行为，降低了被试对于面孔的评分被虚构的同行反馈。这个研究表示mPFC扮演了一个在影响我们与他人判断一致的起因角色。
