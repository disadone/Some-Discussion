To all who knew him, Dan appeared to be a relatively intelligent 12-year-old with a friendly and cooperative manner. Yet, he was struggling in his schoolwork, especially in spelling and reading. These troubles were nothing new. Despite considerable remedial training, these subjects had always been difficult for him. When a school counselor suggested neuropsychological assessment, his parents agreed willingly, hoping that it might shed some light on his problems.

对于所有理解丹的人来说，他似乎是一个相对聪明举止友善和礼貌的12岁小男孩。然而，他曾经再学业上痛苦挣扎，特别是再拼写和阅读方面。这些困难并不算是新鲜事。尽管进行了大量的补救训练，这些东西仍旧对他是一个困难。当一名学校辅导员建议进行神经心理评估时，他的父母欣然同意，希望其能够给他的问题带来一线生机。

Neuropsychological testing revealed no evidence of gross brain damage. His sensory, perceptual, and motor abilities all appeared normal and his overall IQ was in the average range. A more detailed analysis of his abilities revealed that his visuospatial skills were quite good. His score on the Visual Spatial Index of [the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fifth Edition (WISC-V)](https://wechsleriqtest.com/wechsler-intelligence-scale-for-children/), which emphasizes visuomotor and visuospatial abilities, was above average, and he performed well on a number of other tests assessing nonverbal problem solving. In contrast, his performance on the Verbal Comprehension Index of the WISC-V was below average. A number of additional verbal tests revealed that he had little appreciation for the phonemic structure of words. He read words by guessing what they were on the basis of their salient visual features or configuration, rather than by trying to sound them out. For example, he read form as “farm,” theory as “those,” grieve as “great,” and tranquility as “train track.” He exhibited similar problems in the spelling of orally presented words, spelling square as “s-c-a-r,” cross as “c-o-r-s,” and triangle as “t-r-e-r-e.”

神经心理测试显示没有全脑损伤的证据。他的感官，感知和运动能力都表现正常并且他的总体IQ是在平均区间的。一个关于他能力的更加详细分析显示他的视觉空间能力特别好。他在Weschler儿童智力量表第五版（WISC-V）视觉空间指数得分比平均水平高，该得分强调视觉运动和视觉空间能力，他在其他评估非语言问题解决的测试表现得更好。相反，他在WISC-V语言理解指标在平均水平之下。大量额外的语言测试显示他已经他对语言的音素结构鉴识。他通过他们显著的视觉特征或配置猜测读词，而不是通过试着发出声音。例如，他将form读作“farm，” theory读作“those，”grieve读作“great，”和tranquility读作“train track”。他在拼写口头呈现的单词具有相似的困难，square拼写为“s-c-a-r”，cross拼写为“c-o-r-s”，triangle拼写作“t-r-e-r-e”。

Given that his difficulties were long-standing and that remediation so far had not been effective, the neuropsychologist diagnosed Dan as having a specific verbal learning disability that is commonly known as dyslexia. She suggested that further intervention for reading be geared to capitalize on Dan’s good visuospatial abilities, such as teaching him to carefully distinguish words on the basis of their visual features and using flash cards to drill him on the form of words. An incremental approach could be taken; he could first acquire knowledge about simple words and then apply it toward reading more complicated material. For example, once Dan could learn to recognize fly, he could then use that knowledge to help read other words, such as butterfly.

鉴于他的困难是长期存在的，目前为止的补救措施尚未有效，神经心理学家将丹诊断为具有一个具体的语言学习障碍，通常被认为是难语症。她表明未来的阅读干预可以通过用得上丹的好的视觉空间能力，例如教他根据单词的视觉特征仔细区分它们并且用卡片提问他单词的形式。可以采取一种渐进的方式；他可以首先获取简单单词的知识并且之后将之应用于阅读更加复杂的材料。例如，一旦丹可以认识苍蝇，他可以之后使用这个知识帮助阅读其他单词，例如蝴蝶。

The neuropsychologist also explained to Dan’s parents that even with such remediation, he would probably never become a highly fluent reader, which meant that some aspects of formal schooling would remain challenging. However, she also emphasized that such difficulties did not preclude future occupational success for Dan. In fact, numerous famous people are known to be dyslexic, including the actor Tom Cruise, the artist Pablo Picasso, and Ann Bancroft, the first woman to cross the ice to both the North and South Poles. The neuropsychologist suggested to Dan’s parents that they encourage him to pursue areas of study and interests that would capitalize on his above-average visuospatial abilities.

神经心理学家也向丹的父母揭示了，即使采用这种补救方式，他可能永远不能成为一个高度流利的读者，这意味着正规的学校教育的某些方面对他仍旧是一个挑战。然而，她也强调这样的困难并不妨碍丹未来的成功。实际上，大量名人都已知存在诵读困难，包括演员汤姆克鲁斯，艺术家巴勃罗毕加索和安克罗夫特，这是第一位跨越北极和南极的女性。神经心理学家建议丹的父母鼓励他追求用得上他高于常人的视觉空间能力的学习和兴趣领域
