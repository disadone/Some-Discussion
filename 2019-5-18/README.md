People with damage to the OFC perform especially poorly on tasks in which past losses and gains must be considered in order to make appropriate choices in the present. Such deficits have been empirically demonstrated using gambling tasks, in which the participant must choose a particular stimulus that results in either winning or losing money (Bechara et al., 2000; O’Doherty et al., 2001). These tasks are designed so that people cannot simply associate one stimulus with one outcome; rather, the tasks are designed to work probabilistically, so that over time some choices tend to be better than others. In a gambling task, a person might win big by choosing a particular item, but continuing to choose that item over time results in a series of small losses, thus making this choice less profitable than an alternative choice. People with damage to the OFC tend to stick with the “big win” stimulus even though it leads to greater losses over time. This behavior resembles that of a child who cannot resist the impulse to eat a huge piece of cake despite knowing that later on it will lead to an upset stomach. As we discuss in more detail in Chapter 14, similar impairments in decision making are also evident in substance abuse, in which people often make decisions on the basis of immediate gratification while ignoring the long-term consequences. In fact, difficulties in decision making in substance-dependent people are linked to atypical activation in orbitofrontal regions (Tanabe et al., 2013).

具有OFC损伤的人在需要考虑过去的损失和收益来作出合适决定的任务中表现得特别差。这种缺陷已经用赌博任务得到了展示，这种赌博游戏需要被试选择一种会导致赢钱或者输钱特殊刺激。这些任务被特殊设计过使得人们不能简单地将一种刺激与一种结果对应起来；而是，任务被设计成依概率作用，使得一些选择在长期中比另一些选择更好。在赌博任务中，一个人可能通过选择一种特定的物品赢一把大的，但是后续继续选择那个物品导致一系列的小损失，因此使得这个选择比另一种选择赚得少。有OFC损伤的人倾向坚持“赢大”刺激即使它导致长期更大的损失。这个行为就像一个孩子不能抵抗吃大蛋糕的冲动尽管知道它会导致胃部不适。正如我们在第十四章的详细讨论的，在决策行为中的相似损伤也在药物滥用上显著，人们通常依据基于直接的满足做决策而忽略长期的结果。实际上，在药物依赖人群中的决策困难是与眶额区域的非正常的激活相关。

The OFC is especially important for learning in situations that require the individual to respond to changing patterns of reward and punishment. Researchers often study this phenomenon by varying what is called the **[reinforcement contingency](https://dictionary.apa.org/reinforcement-contingency)**, which simply refers to the degree to which a reward or punishment is associated with a particular stimulus or action. Single-cell recording studies in nonhuman primates show that neurons in the OFC respond to the rewarding value of taste, smell, and visual stimuli, and that some neurons respond only when the reinforcement contingencies change (Rolls, 1999). People with OFC damage are impaired in the ability to change their behavior when the contingencies change. One example of such contingency change is referred to as **[reversal learning](https://www.definitions.net/definition/reversal+learning)**. For example, let’s say you were first rewarded for pressing the left button in response to a red light and the right button in response to a green light. In reversal learning, you are now rewarded for pressing the left button for the green light and the right button for the red light. Reversal learning is deficient following OFC damage in humans and other primates (Roberts, 2006). Neuroimaging studies also support the idea that the OFC tracks the changing reward value of a particular stimulus. For example, food becomes less rewarding as a person becomes satiated (full). Correspondingly, OFC activity decreases as the food becomes less desirable with satiation (Kringelbach et al., 2003).

OFC对于要求个人响应不断变化的奖励和惩罚模式的情况下的学习特别重要。研究者经常通过改变所谓的强化相倚来学习这个现象，强化相倚（指某一反应和它产生的环境变化之间的一致性关系）简单来说是将某种奖励或惩罚与一种特定刺激或行动联系的程度。在非人灵长类的单神经元记录研究显示在OFC中神经元响应味觉，嗅觉和视觉刺激的奖励值，并且一些神经元仅仅在强化相倚改变的情况下响应。具有OFC损伤的人损失了在相倚关系变化时他们改变自身行为的能力。一种相倚关系变化的例子叫做逆转学习。例如，我们说你首先由于为响应一盏红灯而按下左按钮，绿灯按下右按钮而得到奖励。在逆转学习中，你由绿灯按下左按钮，红灯按下右按钮而得到奖励。逆转学习在OFC损伤的人类和灵长类动物中是不好做到的。神经影像学也支持OFC追踪某一刺激导致的不断变化的奖励的观点。例如，食物的价值在一个人吃饱的情况下越来越低。


Some studies suggest that different subregions of the OFC respond to rewards versus punishments, an organization that may help the OFC to keep track of changing contingencies (Kringelbach, 2005). According to this viewpoint, the lateral area of the OFC is activated following a punishing outcome in a gambling task, whereas the medial area is activated following a rewarding outcome (O’Doherty et al., 2001). These two regions may act in a reciprocal manner: the medial region increases activation to reward and decreases activation to punishment, whereas the lateral orbitofrontal region exhibits the opposite pattern. Furthermore, the larger the reward or punishment delivered, the greater the brain activation. However, other research suggests that the value of a reward can best be determined by a distributed pattern of activity across orbitofrontal regions, as discerned from multivariate pattern analysis (Kahnt et al., 2010). Regardless, the OFC allows us to represent the costs and benefits associated with any choice, leading to more informed and effective decision making.

一些研究表明OFC的不同区域响应奖励与惩罚，其中的一个组织可能帮助OFC追踪变化的相倚关系。根据这个观点，OFC的外侧区域在赌博任务中得到被惩罚的结果时被激活，同时内侧区域伴随着奖励而被激活。这两个区域可能扮演着一种彼此相反的角色：内侧区域增加对于奖励的激活并且降低对惩罚的激活，同时外侧眶额区域面临着相反的模式。更进一步，更大程度的大脑活跃伴随着更大程度的奖励或惩罚传递到大脑。然而，另一些研究表明奖励的价值最好通过眶额区域活动的分布模式确定，这由多变量模式分析方式得出。无论怎样，OFC允许我们表示与选择相关的成本和收益，引起更具信息和有效的决策。


The OFC is also crucial for evaluating the consequences of our choices. One of the ways that we think about the consequences of our own decision making is to consider what might have happened if we had made a different choice. Would I have been happier if I had bought the Honda rather than the Chevy? When we discover that we made the “wrong” choice, we often feel regret. Interestingly, patients with OFC damage do not appear to feel regret (Camille et al., 2004).

OFC也对于评估我们选择的结果非常重要。一种我们考虑我们自己决定的结果是考虑如果我们当初作出了不一样的选择会发生什么。如果我当初买了本田而不是雪佛兰是不是更开心呢？当我们发现自己做了“错误”的选择，我们通常后悔。有趣的是，有OFC损伤的人没有表现后悔。
