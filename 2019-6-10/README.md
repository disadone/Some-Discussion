### Vagus Nerve Stimulation

Like DBS, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) involves stimulation of the nervous system, but in this case the stimulated structure is the vagus nerve. This nerve carries sensory information from the internal organs – stomach, intestines, heart – into the brain, as well as carrying motor information from the brain to these organs. Just as DBS was adapted from treatments used for Parkinson’s disease, VNS was adapted from treatments used for epilepsy. In the VNS procedure, a device containing stimulating electrodes is implanted in the upper chest, near the collarbone, where it can stimulate the vagus nerve before it enters the brain (see Figure 14.12C). This implantation is less invasive than DBS because the implantation does not penetrate the brain itself, but VNS still involves a surgical procedure and the presence of a foreign device inside the body.

Researchers using VNS to treat epilepsy noticed improvements in the mood of their patients. Building upon this finding, VNS became an experimental treatment for depression (Groves and Brown, 2005). Initial studies found significant improvements in depressive symptoms over time in people treated with VNS (e.g., Marangell et al., 2002; Rush et al., 2000). However, these studies did not directly compare VNS-treated people to untreated or sham-treated controls. A meta-analysis (sponsored by the device manufacturer) compared patients with chronic, treatment-resistant depression who were receiving “treatment as usual” (whatever psychotherapy or drug treatment the patient would normally receive) with similar patients who were receiving both “treatment as usual” and VNS combined. The study found better signs of improvement in the patients with the VNS added (Berry et al., 2013). Thus, evidence for the effectiveness of VNS is accumulating, although inconsistencies across studies persist (Martin and Martin-Sanchez, 2012).

How might VNS work to treat depression? At least two possibilities have been proposed, the first focusing on monoamine neurotransmitters and the second focusing on neural plasticity (Grimonprez et al., 2015). The vagus nerve, coming from the chest cavity, terminates in a brainstem structure known as the nucleus of the solitary tract. The nucleus of the solitary tract projects to the locus coeruleus (also in the brainstem), which is the major source of noradrenergic projections throughout the brain. Therefore, stimulation of the vagus nerve can influence the activity of noradrenaline, a monoamine neurotransmitter associated with arousal and alertness (see Chapter 1). Through this pathway, VNS might act to ameliorate the states of low arousal that are typical in depression. In addition, the nucleus of the solitary tract also connects to limbic structures, projecting directly to the amygdala and indirectly to the hippocampus. VNS may facilitate aspects of neural plasticity, including neurogenesis and synapse production, particularly in the hippocampus (Grimonprez et al., 2015). As with DBS, studies of the effectiveness of VNS have preceded a full understanding of its mechanism of action.
