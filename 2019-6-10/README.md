### Vagus Nerve Stimulation

Like DBS, [vagus nerve stimulation (VNS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagus_nerve_stimulation) involves stimulation of the nervous system, but in this case the stimulated structure is the vagus nerve. This nerve carries sensory information from the internal organs – stomach, intestines, heart – into the brain, as well as carrying motor information from the brain to these organs. Just as DBS was adapted from treatments used for Parkinson’s disease, VNS was adapted from treatments used for epilepsy. In the VNS procedure, a device containing stimulating electrodes is implanted in the upper chest, near the collarbone, where it can stimulate the vagus nerve before it enters the brain (see Figure 14.12C). This implantation is less invasive than DBS because the implantation does not penetrate the brain itself, but VNS still involves a surgical procedure and the presence of a foreign device inside the body.

与DBS相同，迷走神经刺激（VNS）涉及神经系统的刺激，但是在该情况下所刺激的结构是迷走神经。该神经是传递从内部器官-胃部，肠子，心脏-的感觉信息到大脑，也从大脑中传递运动信息到这些器官。正如DBS适用于治疗帕金森症，VNS适用于癫痫的治疗。在VNS过程中，一个包含刺激电极的设备植入在上胸腔中，接近锁骨的位置，这里能够在迷走神经进入大脑钱刺激到该神经（见图14.12C）。这种植入方法比DBS的侵入性小因为植入过程没有穿透大脑本身，但是VNS仍旧涉及手术过程并在身体中放入外部设备。

Researchers using VNS to treat epilepsy noticed improvements in the mood of their patients. Building upon this finding, VNS became an experimental treatment for depression (Groves and Brown, 2005). Initial studies found significant improvements in depressive symptoms over time in people treated with VNS (e.g., Marangell et al., 2002; Rush et al., 2000). However, these studies did not directly compare VNS-treated people to untreated or sham-treated controls. A meta-analysis (sponsored by the device manufacturer) compared patients with chronic, treatment-resistant depression who were receiving “treatment as usual” (whatever psychotherapy or drug treatment the patient would normally receive) with similar patients who were receiving both “treatment as usual” and VNS combined. The study found better signs of improvement in the patients with the VNS added (Berry et al., 2013). Thus, evidence for the effectiveness of VNS is accumulating, although inconsistencies across studies persist (Martin and Martin-Sanchez, 2012).

采用VNS治疗癫痫的研究者注意到了他们病人情绪的改善。基于这个发现，VNS成为了治疗抑郁症的试验方法。初步的研究发现接受VNS治疗的人群随着时间的推移抑郁症状得到明显改善。然而，这些研究没有直接比较接受治疗VNS的人与没治疗或者假治疗的控制组区别。一个荟萃分析（由设备生产商赞助）比较了具有长期治疗顽固型并接受“通常治疗”（病人通常接受的心理或是药物治疗）的抑郁症的患者与相似的但接受“通常治疗”与VNS复合方法的患者进行了对比。研究发现增加VNS治疗的病患具有更好迹象的改善。因此，VNS方法的有效性是累积的，虽然各个研究结论中不一致仍旧存在。

How might VNS work to treat depression? At least two possibilities have been proposed, the first focusing on monoamine neurotransmitters and the second focusing on neural plasticity (Grimonprez et al., 2015). The vagus nerve, coming from the chest cavity, terminates in a brainstem structure known as **the nucleus of the solitary tract**. **The nucleus of the solitary tract** projects to **the locus coeruleus** (also in the brainstem), which is the major source of noradrenergic projections throughout the brain. Therefore, stimulation of the vagus nerve can influence the activity of noradrenaline, a monoamine neurotransmitter associated with arousal and alertness (see Chapter 1). Through this pathway, VNS might act to ameliorate the states of low arousal that are typical in depression. In addition, the nucleus of the solitary tract also connects to limbic structures, projecting directly to the amygdala and indirectly to the hippocampus. VNS may facilitate aspects of neural plasticity, including neurogenesis and synapse production, particularly in the hippocampus (Grimonprez et al., 2015). As with DBS, studies of the effectiveness of VNS have preceded a full understanding of its mechanism of action.

VNS是如何治疗的抑郁症？至少两种可能性已经得到提出，第一种关注单胺类神经递质，第二种关注神经可塑性。传自胸腔的迷走神经终止于被称为孤束核的脑干结构。孤束核投射到蓝斑（也在脑干中），这是大脑中去甲肾上腺素投射的主要来源。因此，迷走神经的刺激可以影响去甲肾上腺素的活动，一种与唤起和警觉有关的单胺类神经递质。通过这条路径，VNS可能会改善抑郁症中通常的低唤醒状态。除此之外，孤束核也与边缘结构相连，其直接投射到杏仁核并间接投射到海马体。VNS可能促进神经可塑性的某些方面，包括神经发生和突出产生，特别是在海马体中。像DBS一样，VNS的有效性先于对其发生机制的理解。
