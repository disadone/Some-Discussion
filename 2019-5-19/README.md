Stimulation studies can go beyond neuroimaging studies in addressing the causal role of specific brain regions in emotion regulation. Because neuroimaging studies can only tell us how brain activity is correlated with different cognitive states, they can’t definitively indicate whether a particular region, such as a region of frontal cortex, is truly a cause of emotion regulation, as opposed to a side effect of that regulation. To address this limitation, one study used [tDCS](https://thebrainstimulator.net/what-is-tdcs/) to stimulate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during [cognitive reappraisal](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki/Cognitive_reappraisal.html) or [free-viewing](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03193551.pdf)conditions (Feeser et al., 2014). The stimulation improved the effectiveness of cognitive reappraisal strategies in modifying peripheral measures of emotional arousal, such as skin conductance. Thus, increasing dorsolateral prefrontal activity had a cause-and-effect impact on emotion regulation.

脑内刺激研究可以比神经影像学研究在强调调节情绪的某个具体脑区的因果作用。因为神经影像学研究只能告诉我们脑活动是如何与不同的认知状态相关的，他们不能确定地表示是否某个具体的区域，例如，前额皮质的一块区域是否真的是情绪管理的原因，而不是由情绪调节产生的副作用。为了强调这个限制，一项采用**tDCS**在**认知重评**或者**随意观看**条件下刺激背外侧前额皮质的研究。刺激改善了认知重评策略在改变情绪唤起的外周测量（例如皮肤电导）方面的有效性。因此，增加的背外侧前额活动对于情绪调节有因果关系。

* **tDCS** stands for Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation and is a form of neurostimulation (also known as neuromodulation) where very low levels of constant current are delivered to specifically targeted areas of the brain, often producing profound results.
* **Cognitive reappraisal** is an emotion regulation strategy that involves changing the trajectory of an emotional response by reinterpreting the meaning of the emotional stimulus.

While most research has focused on cognitive strategies that alter the meaning of the event in some way (i.e., cognitive reappraisal), other research has investigated altering attention as a means of regulating emotion. For example, when people are anxious, they tend to focus their attention on potentially threatening information. However, people can be trained through implicit measures (without awareness) to redirect attention away from threatening information, and such training reduces anxiety (see Bar-Haim, 2010, for review). Neuroimaging data suggest that control regions in the frontal lobe are implicated in such attentional bias training as well (Browning et al., 2010).

同时，大多数研究都聚焦于用一些方法改变事件含义的认知策略（即，认知重评），另一些研究考察了情绪调节方法之一的改变注意力。例如，当人们焦虑时，他们倾向于将注意力放在有潜在威胁的信息上。然而，人们可以通过内隐测量（没有察觉）来将注意力从威胁信息中引导出来，这种训练会降低焦虑程度。神经影像学数据表示在前额叶的控制区域也在注意力偏移训练中起作用。

Not surprisingly, regulating emotion is taxing on mental resources. Perhaps because strategies such as cognitive appraisal *draw upon* the same frontal lobe control systems that we use for executive functions, engaging in challenging emotion regulation activities seems to have an immediate effect of reducing performance on executive function tasks such as [Stroop conflict resolution](https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/stroop.html) (e.g., Inzlicht and Gutsell, 2007). Unfortunately, stress itself also taxes executive functions due to the negative impact of stress on prefrontal cortex functioning (e.g., Arnsten, 2015). This may explain why in stressful real-life circumstances, we are often unsuccessful in using cognitive reappraisal to modify our emotions. Indeed, one study found that after experiencing an acute stressor in the lab (sticking one’s hands in a bucket of ice water, a manipulation known as the [cold pressor test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_pressor_test)), participants were less effective in using cognitive reappraisal to reduce fear conditioning,compared to participants in a control condition, who used cognitive reappraisal effectively (Raio et al., 2013). Such research reminds us of the limits of emotion regulation strategies in various contexts. Though much remains to be learned about emotion regulation, in general these studies so far tell us that when people adopt strategies of emotional control, they can change how their brains respond to emotional situations.

不出所料，调节情绪需要消耗大脑资源。可能时因为例如认知重评这样的策略利用了我们用于执行功能的前额叶系统，前额叶参与挑战情绪调节活动似乎具有降低执行功能例如Stroop矛盾解决的表现的直接作用。不幸的是，压力本身也会降低执行功能，这是由于压力对于前额皮质功能的负向作用。这可能解释了为什么在压力大的真实生活环境中，我们通常不能成功运用认知重评来改善我们的情绪。实际上，一个研究发现在实验室中经历了巨大压力后（在冰水中刺激手掌，这个操作也被称为冷压力测试），被试在使用认知重评方法的降低恐惧条件效果不佳，相较于那些在控制条件下的被试，他们采用认知重评方法更加有效。这样的研究提醒我们情绪调节在不同环境下的限制。虽然许多关于情绪调节的的内容仍要探索，但是总的来说目前为止的这些研究告诉我们当人们采用情绪控制策略的时候，他们可以改变他们的大脑对唤起情绪状况的反应。

The **cold pressor test** is a cardiovascular test performed by immersing the hand into an ice water container, usually for one minute, and measuring changes in blood pressure and heart rate. These changes relate to vascular response and pulse excitability.

## Communicating and Interpreting Emotional Signals

Our emotions are not just felt internally; they are also conveyed to other people. Although we tend to think of language as the dominant means of communication in our species, nonverbal signals of emotion communicate important information among members of a social group. If you meet a friend and notice that her facial expression is angry, you will interact with her differently than if her face bears a happy expression. Likewise, a phrase such as “Susan and Bill have just eloped” can convey very different sorts of information depending on whether it is spoken in an excited, surprised, sad, or angry tone of voice. In the next two sections, we consider the neural systems involved in both perceiving and producing expressions of emotion.

我们的情绪并不仅仅由内在感受；他们也会传递给其他人。虽然我们倾向于将语言作为我们物种交流的主要方式，非言语的情绪信号传递了在一个社会群体中的重要信息。如果你见了一个朋友并且注意到她的面部表情是愤怒的，你会和她用不同的方式交流。例如，一个像“Susan和Bill私奔了”的句子会在说出的人是兴奋、惊讶、伤心或者愤怒的声调下表达不同的信息。在下面两节，我们考虑涉及提取和产生情绪表达的神经系统:w。
